## Quickstart:
### Requirements:
Assuming that you are in a Linux/UNIX like environment, you need:
1. a) On Linux/Unix a reasonably newish version of the gcc compiler (gcc 4.6.2 and onwards work fine)
1. b) Mac/Apple users need to have the Command Line Tools installed
2. GNU Scientific Development Library, (libgsl0-dev and libgsl0 in Ubuntu, gsl-devel in OpenSUSE) 

### Installation:
Briefly:
`./configure` 
`make`  

This package includes two exacutables: `RADpainter` and `fineSTRUCTURE`

### Usage:
1. Calculate the co-ancestry matrix:  `./RADpainter paint INPUT_RAD_FILE.txt`
2. Assign individuals to populations:  `./finestructure -x 100000 -y 100000 -z 1000 INPUT_RAD_FILE_chunks.out INPUT_RAD_FILE_chunks.mcmc.xml`
3. Tree building:  `./finestructure -m T -x 10000 INPUT_RAD_FILE_chunks.out INPUT_RAD_FILE_chunks.mcmc.xml INPUT_RAD_FILE_chunks.mcmcTree.xml`
